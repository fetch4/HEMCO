The HEMCO configuration file
############################

The HEMCO Configuration file is composed of several sections:
:ref:`Settings <hco-cfg-set>`,
:ref:`Base Emissions <hco-cfg-base>`,
:ref:`Scale Factors, <hco-cfg-scalefac>`, and
:ref:`Masks <hco-cfg-masks>`.

An overview of the structure and key formats of the HEMCO configuration file
can be found in Figure 2 of :cite:t:`Lin_et_al._2021`:

   ### END SECTION SETTINGS ###

The order within the settings section is irrelevant. Many of the
settings described below are optional, and default values will be used
if not explicitly set.

.. _hco-cfg-set-diagnfile:

DiagnFile
---------

Specifies the configuration file for the HEMCO default diagnostics
collection. This file is customarily  named :file:`HEMCO_Diagn.rc`.
For more information, please see :ref:`Default
diagnostics collection <hco-diag-default>` section.

.. _hco-cfg-set-diagnfreq:

DiagnFreq
---------

This setting (located in the HEMCO configuration file) specifies
the output frequency of the :ref:`Default  <hco-diag-default>`
collection.  Allowable values are:

+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Value               | What it does                                   |
+=====================+================================================+
| ``Always``          | Archives diagnostics on each time step.        |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``Annually``        | Sets the diagnostic period to 1 year.          |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``Daily``           | Sets the diagnostic period to 1 day.           |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``End``             | Sets the diagnostic period so that output will |
|                     | only occur at the end of the simulation.       |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``Hourly``          | Sets the diagnostic period to 1 hour.          |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``Monthly``         | Sets the diagnostic period to 1 month          |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| ``YYYYMMDD hhmnss`` | Sets the diagnostic period to a 15-digit       |
|                     | string (year-month-day hour-minute-second)     |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------+

Some examples of the :literal:`YYYMMDD hhmmss` option are:

- :code:`00010000 000000` will generate diagnostic output once
  per year.
- :code:`00000001 000000` will generate diagnostic output once
  per day.
- :code:`00000000 020000` will generate diagnostic output every
  2 hours.
- etc.

.. _hco-cfg-set-diagnolevdim:

DiagNoLevDim
------------

This option must be explicity added to the HEMCO configuration
file. If omitted, the default behavior will be :code:`false`.

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Value     | What it does                                           |
+===========+========================================================+
| ``true``  | The :file:`HEMCO_diagnostics*.nc` files will be        |
|           | created with :literal:`(time,lat,lon)` dimensions.     |
|           | [#B]_                                                  |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``false`` | The :file:`HEMCO_diagnostics*.nc` files will always    |
|           | be created with :literal:`(time,lev,lat,lon)`          |
|           | dimensions.                                            |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

.. rubric:: Notes for DiagNoLevDim

.. [#B] But if at least one of the diagnostic quantities has a
	:literal:`lev` dimension, then the created files will have
        :literal:`(time,lev,lat,lon)` dimensions.

.. _hco-cfg-set-diagnprefix:

DiagnPrefix
-----------

Specifies the name of the diagnostic files to be created.  For
example:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   DiagnPrefix: ./OutputDir/HEMCO_diagnostics

will create HEMCO diagnostics files in the :file:`OutputDir/`
subdirectory of the run directory, and all files will begin with
the text :file:`HEMCO_diagnostics`.

.. _hco-cfg-set-diagnreftime:

DiagnRefTime
------------

This option must be explicity added to the HEMCO configuration
file.

By default, the value of the :literal:`time:units` attribute in the
:file:`HEMCO_diagnostics.*.nc` files will be

.. code-block:: kconfig

   hours since YYYY-MM-DD hh:mn:ss`,

where :literal:`YYYY-MM-DD hh:mn:ss` is the diagnostics datetime.
This default value can be overridden with:

.. code-block:: console

   DiagnRefTime: hours since 1985-01-01 00:00:00

which will reset the :literal:`time:units` attribute in the
:file:`HEMCO_diagnostics*.nc` files accordingly.

.. _hco-cfg-set-diagntimestamp:

DiagnTimeStamp
--------------

This option must be explicity added to the HEMCO configuration
file.  If omitted, the default behavior will be :literal:`End`.

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

|           | :code:`20220101 000000` to :code:`20220101 010000`     |
|           | will create a diagnostic file named                    |
|           | :file:`HEMCO_Diagnostics.202201010000.nc`.             |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``Mid``   | Uses the date and time at the midpoint of the          |
|           | diagnostics period to o timestamp diagnostic           |
|           | files. |br|                                            |

|           | will create a diagnostic file named                    |
|           | :file:`HEMCO_Diagnostics.202201010030.nc`.             |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| ``End``   | Uses the date and time at the end of the diagnostics   |
|           | period to timestamp diagnostic files. |br|             |
|           | |br|                                                   |
|           | With this option, a 1-hour simulation from             |
|           | :code:`20220101 000000` to :code:`20220101 010000`     |
|           | will create a diagnostic file named                    |
|           | :file:`HEMCO_Diagnostics.202201010100.nc`.             |
+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+

.. _hco-cfg-set-mask-fractions:

Mask fractions
--------------

+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+
| Value     | What it does                                         |
+===========+======================================================+
| ``true``  | Fractional mask values are taken into account.  This |
|           | means that mask values can take any value between    |
|           | 0.0 and 1.0.                                         |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------+

---------------

+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Value   | What it does                                              |
+=========+===========================================================+
| ``0``   | No negative values are allowed **(Default setting)**      |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``1``   | All negative values are set to zero and a warning         |
|         | message is printed.                                       |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``2``   | Negative values are kept as they are.                     |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

.. _hco-cfg-set-pbl-dry-deposition:

+===========+===========================================================+
| ``true``  | Assumes that dry deposition occurs over the entire        |
|           | planetary boundary layer (PBL).  In this case, extensions |
|           | that include loss terms (e.g. air-sea exchange) will      |
|           | calculate a loss term for every grid box that is partly   |

Integer value denoting the tolerance against differences between
the units set in the :ref:`HEMCO configuration file <hco-cfg>`
and the netCDF :literal:`units` attribute found in the source file.

+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Setting | What it does                                              |
+=========+===========================================================+
| ``0``   | **No tolerance**.  A units mismatch will halt a HEMCO     |
|         | simulation.                                               |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``1``   | **Medium tolerance**.  A units mismatch will print a      |
|         | warning message, but will not halt a HEMCO simulation.    |
|         | **(Default setting)**                                     |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``2``   | **High tolerance**.  A units mismatch will be ignored.    |
+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

.. _hco-cfg-set-verbose:

Verbose
-------

+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Value     | What it does                                           |
+===========+========================================================+
| ``true``  | Activates additional printout for debugging purposes.  |

+==========+===========================================================+
| ``root`` | Restricts :ref:`hco-cfg-set-verbose` output to the        |
|          | root core.  This facilitates running HEMCO in Earth       |
|          | System Models, where the additional overhead of printing  |
|          | verbose output on every core could negatively impact      |
|          | performance.   **(Default setting)**                      |
+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| ``all``  | Prints :ref:`hco-cfg-set-verbose` output on all           |

+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

.. _hco-cfg-set-wildcard:

Wildcard
--------

Wildcard character.  On Linux/MacOS this should be set to :literal:`*`.

.. _hco-cfg-settings-usrdef:

User-defined tokens
-------------------

Users can specify any additional token in the **Settings** section
section. The token name/value pair must be separated by the colon (:)
sign. For example, adding the following line to the settings section
would register token :literal:`$ENS` (and assign value 3 to it):

.. code-block:: kconfig

   ENS: 3

User-defined tokens can be used the same way as the built-in tokens
(:literal:`$ROOT`, :literal:`$RES`, :literal:`YYYY`, etc.). See
:literal:`sourceFile` in the Base emissions for more details about
tokens.

.. important::

   User-defined token names must not contain numbers or
   special characters such as :literal:`.`, :literal:`_`,
   :literal:`-`, or :literal:`x`.

.. _hco-cfg-ext-switches:

==================
Extension switches
==================

HEMCO performs automatic emission calculations using all fields that
belong to the :ref:`base emisisons extension <hco-cfg-base>`. Additional
emissions that depend on environmental parameter such as wind speed or
air temperature--and/or that use non-linear parameterizations--are
calculated through :ref:`hco-ext`.  A list of currently implemented
extensions in HEMCO is given in `Keller et al. (2014)
<#References>`__. To add new extensions to HEMCO, modifications of the
source code are required, as described further in :ref:`hco-hood`.

The first section of the configuration file lists all available
extensions and whether they shall be used or not. For each extension,
the following attributes need to be specified:

.. _hco-cfg-ext-switches-extnr:

ExtNr
-----

Extension number associated with this field. All
:ref:`base emissions <hco-cfg-base>` should have extension number
zero.  The extension number` of the data listed in section
:ref:`hco-ext` data must match with the corresponding extension
number.

The extension number can be set to the wildcard character. In that
case, the field is read by HEMCO (if the assigned species name
matches any of the HEMCO species, see :ref:`hco-cfg-base-species`) but
not used for emission calculation. This is particularly useful if
HEMCO is only used for data I/O but not for emission calculation.

.. _hco-cfg-ext-switches-extname:

ExtName
-------

Name of the HEMCO extension.

.. _hco-cfg-ext-switches-on-off:

On/Off
------

+---------+-----------------------------------+
| Value   | What it does                      |
+=========+===================================+
| ``on``  | The extension will be used.       |
+---------+-----------------------------------+
| ``off`` | The extension will not be used.   |
+---------+-----------------------------------+

.. _hco-cfg-ext-switches-species:

Species
-------

List of species to be used by this extension. Multiple species are
separated by the :ref:`hco-cfg-set-separator` symbol
(e.g. :literal:`/`). All listed species must be supported by the given
extension.

- For example, the **SoilNOx** emissions extension only supports one
  species (NO). An error will be raised if additional species are
  listed.

Additional extension-specific settings can also be specified in the
'Extensions Settings' section (see also an example in
:ref:`edit-hco-cfg` and the definition of
:ref:`hco-cfg-data-coll`. These settings must immediately follow the
extension definition.

HEMCO expects an extension with extension number zero, denoted the
:ref:`Base Emisisons extension <hco-cfg-base>` extension. All emission
fields linked to the base extension will be used for automatic
emission calculation. Fields assigned to any other extension number
will not be inlcuded in the base emissions calculation, but they are
still read/regridded by HEMCO (and can be made available readily
anywhere in the model code). These data are only read if the
corresponding extension is enabled.

All species to be used by HEMCO must be listed in column
:ref:`hco-cfg-ext-switches-species` of the base extension switch. In
particular, all species used by any of the other extensions must also
be listed as base species, otherwise they will not be recognized. It
is possible (and recommended) to use the :ref:`hco-cfg-set-wildcard`
character, in which case HEMCO automatically determines what species
to use by matching the atmospheric model species names with the
species names assigned to the base emission fields and/or any emission
extension.

The environmental fields (wind speed, temperature, etc.) required by the
extensions are either passed from the atmospheric model or read through
the HEMCO configuration file, as described in :ref:`hco-ext`.

.. _hco-cfg-base:

==============
Base emissions
==============

The BASE EMISSIONS section lists all base emission fields and how they
are linked to :ref:`scale factors <hco-cfg-scalefac>`. Base emissions
settings must be included between these comment lines:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   ###############################################################################
   ### BEGIN SECTION BASE EMISSIONS
   ###############################################################################
   settings go here

   ### END SECTION BASE EMISSIONS ###

The :ref:`hco-cfg-ext-switches-extnr` field is defined in
:ref:`hco-cfg-ext-switches`. Other attributes that need to be defined
for each base emissions entry are:

.. _hco-cfg-base-name:

Name
----

Descriptive field identification name. Two consecutive underscore
characters (:literal:`__`) can be used to attach a 'tag' to a
name. This is only of relevance if multiple base emission fields
share the same species, category, hierarchy, and scale factors. In
this case, emission calculation can be optimized by assigning field
names that onlydiffer by its tag to those fields
(e.g. :literal:`DATA__SECTOR1`, :literal:`DATA__SECTOR2`, etc.).

For fields assigned to extensions other than the base extension
(:literal:`ExtNr = 0`), the field names are prescribed and must not
be modified because the data is identified by these extensions by
name.

.. _hco-cfg-base-sourcefile:

sourceFile
----------

Specifies the path and name of the input file.  You may include the
following **name tokens**, which will be evaluated at runtime.

As an alternative to an input file, **geospatial uniform values**
can directly be specified in the configuration file (see e.g. scale
factor :literal:`SO2toSO4` in :ref:`edit-hco-cfg`).

If multiple values are provided (separated by the :ref:`separator
character <hco-cfg-set-separator>` character), they are interpreted
as different time slices. In this case, the
:ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` attribute can be used to specify the
times associated with the individual slices.

If no time attribute is set, HEMCO attempts to determine the time
slices from the number of data values:

+-------------+---------------------------------+
| # of values | Interpretation by HEMCO         |
+=============+=================================+
| 7           | Days of week (Sun, Mon .. Sat)  |
+-------------+---------------------------------+
| 12          | Months (Jan, Feb, .. Dec)       |
+-------------+---------------------------------+
| 24          | Hours of day (01, 02, .. 23)    |
+-------------+---------------------------------+

Uniform values can be combined with **mathematical expressions**. For
example, to model a sine-wave emission source, enter

.. code-block:: kconfig

   MATH:2.0+sin(HH/12*PI)

**Country-specific data** can be provided through an ASCII file
(:literal:`.txt`). In an ESMF environment you must specify the
absolute file path rather than use the $ROOT specifier. More
details on the country-specific data option are given in the
Input File Format section.

If this entry is **left empty** (:literal:`-`), the filename from
the preceding entry is taken, and the next 5 attributes will be
ignored (see entry :literal:`MACCITY_SO4` in :ref:`edit-hco-cfg`.

.. _hco-cfg-base-sourcevar:

sourceVar
---------

Source file variable of interest. Leave empty (:literal:`-`) if
values are directly set through the :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcefile`
attribute or if :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcefile` is empty.

.. _hco-cfg-base-sourcetime:

sourceTime
----------

This attribute defines the time slices to be used and the data
refresh frequency. The format is
:literal:`year/month/day/hour`. Accepted are discrete dates for
time-independent data (e.g. :literal:`2000/1/1/0`) and time ranges
for temporally changing fields
(e.g. :literal:`1980-2007/1-12/1-31/0-23`). Data will automatically
become updated as soon as the simulation date enters a new time
interval.

The provided time attribute determines the data refresh
frequency. It does not need to correspond to the datetimes of the
input file.

Examples:

- If the input file contains daily data of
  year 2005 and the time attribute is set to :literal:`2005/1/1/0`,
  the file  will be read just once (at the beginning  of the
  simulation) and the data of Jan 1, 2005 is used throughout the
  simulation. |br|
  |br|
- If the time attribute is set to :literal:`2005/1-12/1/0`, the
  data is updated on every month, using the first day data of the
  given month. For instance, if the simulation starts on July 15,
  the data of July 1,2005 are used until August 1, at which point
  the  data will be refreshed to values from August 1, 2005. |br|
  |br|
- A time attribute of :literal:`2005/1-12/1-31/0` will make
  sure that the input data are refreshed daily to the current day's
  data. |br|
  |br|
- Finally, if the time attribute is set to
  :literal:`2005/1-12/1-31/0-23`, the data file is read every
  simulation hour, but the same daily data is used throughout the
  day (since there are no hourly data in the file). Providing too
  high update frequencies is not recommended unless the data
  interpolation option is enabled (see below).

If the provided time attributes do not match a datetime of the
input file, the **most likely** time slice is selected. The most
likely time slice is determined based on the specified source time
attribute, the datetimes available in the input file, and the
current simulation date. In most cases, this is just the closest
available time slice that lies in the past.

- For example, if a file contains annual data from 2005 to 2010 and
  the source time attribute is set to :literal:`2005-2010/1-12/1/0`,
  the data of 2005 is used for all simulation months in 2005. |br|
  |br|
- More complex datetime selections occur for files with
  discontinuous time slices, e.g. a file with monthly data for
  year 2005, 2010, 2020, and 2050. In this case, if the time
  attribute is set to :literal:`2005-2020/1-12/1/0`, the monthly
  values of 2005 are (re-)used for all years between 2005 and 2010,
  the monthly values of 2010 are used for simulation years 2010 -
  2020, etc.

It is possible to use tokens :literal:`$YYYY`, :literal:`$MM`,
:literal:`$DD`, and :literal:`$HH`, which will automatically be
replaced by the current simulation date. Weekly data (e.g. data
changing by the day of the week) can be indicated by setting the
day attribute to :literal:`WD` (the wildcard character will work,
too, but is not recommended). Weekly data needs to consist of at
least seven time slices - in increments of one day - representing
data for every weekday starting on Sunday. It is possible to store
multiple weekly data, e.g. for every month of a year:
:literal:`2000/1-12/WD/0`. These data must contain  time slices for
the first seven days of every month, with the first day per month
representing Sunday data, then followed by Monday,
etc. (irrespective of the real weekdays of the given month). If the
wildcard character is used for the days, the data will be
interpreted if (and only if) there are exactly seven time
slices. See the Input File Format section for more details. Default
behavior is to interpret weekly data as 'local time', i.e. token
:literal:`WD` assumes that the provided values are in local
time. It is possible to use weekly data referenced to UTC time
using token :literal:`UTCWD`.

Similar to the weekday option, there is an option to indicate
hourly data that represents local time: :literal:`LH`. If using
this flag, all hourly data of a given time interval (day, month,
year) are read into memory and the local hour is picked at every
location. A downside of this is that all hourly time slices in
memory are updated based on UTC time. For instance, if a file holds
local hourly data for every day of the year, the source time
attribute can be set to :literal:`2011/1-12/1-31/LH`. On every new
day (according to UTC time), this will read all 24 hourly time
slices of that UTC day and use those hourly data for the next 24
hours. For the US, for instance, this results in the wrong daily
data being used for the last 6-9 hours of the day (when UTC time is
one day ahead of local US time).

There is a difference between source time attributes
:literal:`2005-2008/$MM/1/0` and :literal:`2005-2008/1-12/1/0`. In
the first case, the file will be updated annually, while the update
frequency is monthly in the second case. The token :literal:`$MM`
simply indicates that the current simulation month shall be used
whenever the file is updated, but it doesn’t imply a refresh
interval. Thus, if the source time attribute is set to
:literal:`$YYYY/$MM/$DD/$HH`, the file will be read only once and
the data of the simulation start date is taken (and used throughout
the simulation). For uniform values directly set in the
configuration file, all time attributes but one must be fixed,
e.g. valid entries are :literal:`1990-2007/1/1/0` or
:literal:`2000/1-12/1/1`, but not :literal:`1990-2007/1-12/1/1`.

.. note::

   All data read from netCDF file are assumed to be in UTC time,
   except for weekday data that are always assumed to be in local
   time. Data read from the configuration file and/or from ASCII are
   always assumed to be in local time.

It is legal to keep different time slices in different files,
e.g. monthly data of multiple years can be stored in files
:file:`file_200501.nc`, :file:`file_200502.nc`, ...,
:file:`file_200712.nc`.  By setting the source file attribute to
:file:`file_$YYYY$MM.nc` and the source time attribute to
:file:`2005-2007/1-12/1/0`, data of :file:`file_200501.nc` is used
for simulation dates of January 2005 (or any January of a previous
year), etc. The individual files can also contain only a subset of
the provided data range, e.g. all monthly files of a year can be
stored in one file: :file:`file_2005.nc`, :file:`file_2006.nc`,
:file:`file_2007.nc`. In this case, the source file name should be
set to :file:`file_$YYYY`, but the source time attribute should
still be :literal:`2005-2007/1-12/1/0` to indicate that the field
shall be updated monthly.

This attribute can be set to the wildcard character (:literal:`*`), which
will force the file to be updated on every HEMCO time step.

File reference time can be shifted by a fixed amount by adding an
optional fifth element to the time stamp attribute. For instance,
consider the case where 3-hourly averages are provided in
individual files with centered time stamps, e.g.:
:file:`file.yyyymmdd_0130z.nc`, :file:`file.yyyymmdd_0430z.nc`,
..., :file:`file.yyymmdd_2230z.nc`. To read these files **at the
beginning of their time intervals**, the time stamp can be shifted by
90 minutes: :literal:`2000-2016/1-12/1-31/0-23/+90minutes`.  At
time 00z, HEMCO will then read file 0130z and keep using this file
until 03z, when it switches to file 0430z. Similarly, it is
possible to shift the file reference time by any number of years,
months, days, or hours. Time shifts can be forward or backward in
time (use :literal:`-` sign to shift backwards).

.. _hco-cfg-base-cre:

CRE
---

Controls the time slice selection if the simulation date is outside
the range provided in attribute source time (see above). The
following options are available:

.. option:: C

   **Cycling:**  Data are interpreted as climatology and recycled
   once the end of the last time slice is reached. For instance, if
   the input data contains monthly data of year 2000, and the
   source time attribute is set to :literal:`2000/1-12/1/0 C`, the
   same monthly data will be re-used every year.

   If the input data spans multiple years (e.g. monthly data from
   2000-2003), the closest available year will be used outside of
   the available range (e.g. the monthly data of 2003 is used for
   all simulation years after 2003).

.. option:: CS

   **Cycling, Skip:** Data are interpreted as climatology and recycled
   once the end of the last time slice is reached. Data that aren't
   found are skipped. This is useful when certain fields aren't found
   in a restart file and, in that case, those fields will be
   initialized to default values.

.. option:: CY

   **Cycling, Use Simulation Year:**, Same as :option:`C`, except
   it does not allow :envvar:`Emission year` setting to override
   the simulation year.

.. option:: CYS

   **Cycling, Use Simulation Year, Skip:**  Same as :option:`CS`,
   except it does not allow :envvar:`Emission year` setting to
   override the simulation year.

.. option:: R

   **Range:** Data are only considered as long as the simulation
   time is within the time range specified in attribute
   :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime`. The provided range does not necessarily
   need to match the time stamps of the input file. If it is
   outside of the range of the netCDF time stamps, the closest
   available date will be used.

   For instance, if a file contains data for years 2003 to 2010 and
   the  provided range is set to :literal:`2006-2010/1/1/0 R`, the
   file will only be considered between simulation years
   2006-2010. For simulation years 2006 through 2009, the
   corresponding field on the file is used. For all years beyond
   2009, data of year 2010 is used. If the simulation date is
   outside the provided time range, the data is ignored but HEMCO
   does not return an error---the field is simply treated as empty
   (a corresponding warning is issued in the HEMCO log file).

   - Example: if the source time attribute is set to
     :literal:`2000-2002/1-12/1/0 R`, the data will be used for
     simulation years 2000 to 2002 and ignored  for all other years.

.. option:: RA

   **Range, Averaging Otherwise:** Combination of flags :option:`R`
   and :option:`A`. As long as the simulation year is within the
   specified year range, HEMCO will use just the data from that
   particular year. As soon as the simulation year is outside the
   specified year range, HEMCO will use the data averaged over the
   specified years.  Here are some examples:

   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | Setting                   | What this does                                   |
   +===========================+==================================================+
   | ``2015-2020/1-12/1/0 R``  | Uses monthly mean data only within simulation    |
   |                           | simulation years 2015-2020, and ignores the data |
   |                           | outside of this time range.                      |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | ``2015-2020/1-12/1/0 A``  | HEMCO will always use the 2015-2020 averaged     |
   |                           | monthly values, even for simulation years 2015   |
   |                           | through 2020.                                    |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
   | ``2015-2020/1-12/1/0 RA`` | Uses the monthly data of the current year if the |
   |                           | simulation year is within the range 2015-2020,   |
   |                           | and the 2015-2020 average for years before 2015  |
   |                           | and after 2020, respectively.                    |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

.. option:: RF

   **Range, Forced:**  Same as :option:`R`, but HEMCO stops with an
   error if the simulation date is outside the provided range.

.. option:: RY

   **Range, Use Simulation Year:** Same as :option:`R`, except
   it does not allow :envvar:`Emission year` to override the
   simulation year.

.. option:: RFY

   **Range, Forced, Use Simulation Year**.  Same as :option:`RY`,
   except it does not allow :envvar:`Emission year` to override the
   simulation year.

.. option:: RFY3

   **Ranged, Forced, Use Simulation Year, 3-hourly data**: Same as
   :option:`RFY`, but used with data that is read from disk every 3
   hours (e.g. meteorological data and related quantities).

.. option:: E

   **Exact:**  Fields are only used if the time stamp on the field
   exactly matches the current simulation datetime. In all other
   cases, data is ignored but HEMCO does not return an error.

   Example:

   - :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` and :ref:`hco-cfg-base-cre`:
     :literal:`2013-2023/1-12/1-31/0 E`

     Every time the simulation enters a new day, HEMCO will attempt to
     find a data field for the current simulation date. If no such
     field can be found in the file, the data is ignored (and a
     warning is prompted). This setting is particularly useful for
     data that is highly sensitive to date and time, e.g. restart
     variables.

.. option:: EF

   **Exact, Forced:** Same as :option:`E`, but HEMCO stops with an
   error if no data field can be found for the current simulation
   date and time.

.. option:: EC

   **Exact, Read/Query Contiuously.**.

.. option:: ECF

   **Exact, Read/Query Continuously, Forced.**

.. option:: EFYO

   **Exact, Forced, Simulation Year, Once**: Same as :option:`EF`,
   with the following additions:

   - :envvar:`Y`: HEMCO will stop thie simulation if the simulation
	year does not match the year in the file timestamp.
   - :envvar:`O`: HEMCO will only read the file once.

   This setting is typically only used for model restart files
   (such as `GEOS-Chem Classic restart files
   <https://geos-chem.readthedocs.io/en/stable/gcc-guide/04-data/restart-files-gc.html>`_).
   This ensures that the simulation will stop unless the restart
   file timestamp matches the simulation start date and time.

   .. attention::

      Consider changing the time cycle flag from :option:`EFYO` to
      :option:`CYS` if you would like your simulation to read a
      data file (such as a simulation restart file) whose file
      timestamp differs from the simulaton start date and time.

.. option:: EY

   **Exact, Use Smulation Year:** Same as :option:`E`, except it
   does not allow :envvar:`Emission year` setting to override the
   simulation year.

.. option:: A

   **Averaging:** Tells HEMCO to average the data over the
   specified range of years.

   - For instance, setting :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` to
     :literal:`1990-2010/1-12/1/0 A` will cause HEMCO to calculate
     monthly means between 1990 to 2010 and use these regardless of
     the current simulation date.

   The data from the different years can be spread out over multiple
   files. For example, it is legal to use the averaging flag in
   combination with files that use year tokens such as
   :literal:`file_$YYYY.nc`.

.. option:: I

   **Interpolation:** Data fields are interpolated in time. As an
   example, let's assume a file contains annual data for years
   2005, 2010, 2020, and 2050. If :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` is set to
   :literal:`2005-2050/1/1/0 I`, data becomes interpolated between
   the two closest years every time we enter a new simulation
   year. If the simulation starts on January 2004, he value of 2005
   is used for years 2004 and 2005. At the beginning of 2006, the
   used data is calculated as a weighted mean for the 2005 and 2010
   data, with 0.8 weight given to 2005 and 0.2 weight given to 2010
   values. Once the simulation year changes to 2007, the weights
   hange to 0.6 for 2005 and 0.4 for 2010, etc. The interpolation
   frequency is determined by :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` the source time
   attribute.

   For example, setting the source time attribute to
   :literal:`2005-2050/1-12/1/0 I` would result in a recalculation
   of the weights on every new simulation month. Interpolation
   works in a very similar manner for discontinuous monthly,daily,
   and hourly data. For instance if a file contains monthly data of
   2005, 2010, 2020, and 2050 and the source time attribute is set
   to :literal:`2005-2050/1-12/1/0 I`, the field is recalculated
   every month using the two bracketing fields of the given month:
   July 2007 values are calculated from July 2005 and July 2010
   data (with weights of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively), etc.

   Data interpolation also works between multiple files. For
   instance, if monthly data are stored in files
   :literal:`file_200501.nc`, :file:`file_200502.nc`, etc., a
   combination of source file name :file:`file_$YYYY$MM.nc` and
   :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` attribute :literal:`2005-2007/1-12/1-31/0
   :literal:I` will result in daily data interpolation between the two
   bracketing files, e.g. if the simulation day is July 15, 2005,
   the fields current values are calculated from files
   :literal:`file_200507.nc` and :literal:`file_200508.nc`,
   respectively.

   Data interpolation across multiple files also works if there are
   file 'gaps', for example if there is a file only every three
   hours: :file:`file_20120101_0000.nc`,
   :file:`file_20120101_0300.nc`,  etc. Hourly data interpolation
   between those files can be achieved by setting source file to
   :file:file_$YYYY$MM$DD_$HH00.nc`, and :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime` to
   :literal:`2000-2015/1-12/1-31/0-23 I` (or whatever the covered
   year range is).

.. _hco-cfg-base-srcdim:

SrcDim
------

Specifies the spatial dimension of the input data and/or the
model levels into which emissions will be placed.  Here are some
examples that illustrate its use.

.. rubric:: Notes for SrcDim

.. [#A] Arbitrary additional dimensions are currently not supported in
        a high-performance environment that uses the ESMF/MAPL
        input/output libraries.

.. _hco-cfg-base-srcunit:

SrcUnit
-------

Units of the data.

.. _hco-cfg-base-species:

Species
-------

HEMCO emission species name. Emissions will be added to this
species. All HEMCO emission species are defined at the beginning of
the simulation (see the Interfaces section) If the species name
does not match any of the HEMCO species, the field is ignored
altogether.

The species name can be set to the wildcard character, in which
case the field is always read by HEMCO but no species is assigned
to it. This can be useful for extensions that import some
(species-independent) fields by name.

.. _hco-cfg-base-scalids:

ScalIDs
-------

Identification numbers of all scale factors and masks that shall be
applied to this base emission field. Multiple entries must be
separated by the separator character. ScalIDs must csorrespond to the
numbers provided in the :ref:`hco-cfg-scalefac` and

.. note::

   This option only takes effect for fields that are assigned to the
   base extension (:literal:`ExtNr = 0`).

.. _hco-cfg-base-cat:

Cat
---

Emission category. Used to distinguish different, independent
emission sources. Emissions of different categories are always
added to each other.

Up to three emission categories can be assigned to each entry
(separated by the separator character).  Emissions are always
entirely written into the first listed category, while emissions of
zero are used for any other assigned category.

In practice, the only time when more than one emissions category
needs to be specified is when an :ref:`inventory does not separate
between anthropogenic, biofuels, and/or trash emissions
<edit-hco-cfg-ex6>`

For example, the CEDS inventory uses categories :literal:`1/2/12`
because CEDS lumps both biofuel emissions and trash emissions with
anthropogenic Because. The :literal:`1/2/12` category designation
means "Put everything into the first listed category
(1=anthropogenic), and set the other listed categories (2=biofuels,
12=trash) to zero.

.. note::

   This option only takes effect for fields that are assigned to the
   base extension (:literal:`ExtNr = 0`).

.. _hco-cfg-base-hier:

Hier
----

Emission hierarchy. Used to prioritize emission fields within the
same emission category.  Emissions of higher hierarchy overwrite
lower hierarchy data. Fields are only considered within their
defined domain, i.e. regional inventories are only considered
within their mask boundaries.

.. note::

   This option only takes effect for fields that are assigned to the
   base extension (:literal:`ExtNr = 0`).

.. _hco-cfg-scalefac:

=============
Scale factors
=============

The SCALE FACTORS section of the configuration file lists all scale
factors applied to the base emission field. Scale factors that are not
used by any of the base emission fields are ignored. Scale factors can
represent:

#. Temporal emission variations including diurnal, seasonal, or
   interannual variability;
#. Regional masks that restrict the applicability of the base inventory
   to a given region; or
#. Species-specific scale factors, e.g., to split lumped organic
   compound emissions into individual species.

This sample snippet of the HEMCO configuration file shows how scale
factors can either be read from a netCDF file or listed as a set of
values.

=====
Masks
=====

This section lists all masks used by HEMCO. Masks are binary scale
factors (1 inside the mask region, 0 outside). If masks are regridded,
the remapped mask values (1 and 0) are determined through regular
rounding, i.e. a remapped mask value of 0.49 will be set to 0 while 0.5
will be set to 1.

The MASKS section in the HEMCO configuration file will look similar to
this (it will vary depending on the type of GEOS-Chem simulation you are
using):

The required attributes for mask fields are described below:

Options :ref:`hco-cfg-base-scale-scalid` and
:ref:`hco-cfg-base-scale-oper` are described in
:ref:`hco-cfg-scalefac`.

:ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcetime`, :ref:`hco-cfg-base-cre`,
:ref:`hco-cfg-base-srcdim`, and :ref:`hco-cfg-base-srcunit` are
described in :ref:`hco-cfg-base`.

The :envvar:`Box` option is deprecated.

Instead of specifying the :ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcefile` and
:ref:`hco-cfg-base-sourcevar` fields, you can directly provide the
lower left and upper right box coordinates:
:literal:`Lon1/Lat1/Lon2/Lat2` . Longitudes must be in degrees east,
latitudes in degrees north. Only grid boxes whose mid points
are within the specified mask boundaries.  You may also
specify a single grid point (:literal:`Lon1/Lat1/Lon1/Lat1/`).

.. _hco-cfg-masks-caveat:

Caveat for simulations using cropped horizontal grids
-----------------------------------------------------

Consider the following combination of global and regional
emissions inventories:

In the :ref:`Base Emissions <hco-cfg-base>` section:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   0 GLOBAL_INV_SPC1   ...  SPC1 -     1 5
   0 INVENTORY_1_SPC1  ...  SPC1 1001  1 56
   0 INVENTORY_2_SPC1  ...  SPC1 1002  1 55

In the :ref:`Masks <hco-cfg-masks>` section:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   1001 REGION_1_MASK ... 1 1 70/10/140/60
   1002 REGION_2_MASK ... 1 1 46/-12/180/82

For clarity, we have omitted the various elements in these entries of
:file:`HEMCO_Config.rc` that are irrelevant to this issue.

With this setup, we should expect the following behavior:

   #. Species :literal:`SPC1` should be emitted globally from inventory
      :literal:`GLOBAL_INV` (hierarchy = 5). |br|
      |br|

   #. Regional emissions of :literal:`SPC1` from
      :literal:`INVENTORY_1` (hierarchy = 56) should overwrite global
      emissions in the region specified by :literal:`REGION_1_MASK`. |br|
      |br|

   #. Likewise, regional emissions of :literal:`SPC1` from
      :literal:`INVENTORY_2` (hierarchy = 55) should overwrite global
      emissions in the region specified by :literal:`REGION_2_MASK`. |br|
      |br|

   #. In the locations where :literal:`REGION_2_MASK` intersects
      :literal:`REGION_1_MASK`, emissions from
      :literal:`INVENTORY_1` will be applied. This is because
      :literal:`INVENTORY_1` has a higher hierarchy (56) than
      :literal:`INVENTORY_2` (55).

When running simulations that use cropped grids, one or both of the
boundaries specified for the masks (:literal:`70/10/140/60` and
:literal:`46/-12/180/82`) in :file:`HEMCO_Config.rc` can potentially
extend beyond the bounds of the simulation domain.  If this should
happen, HEMCO would treat the regional inventories as if they were
global, the emissions for the highest hierarchy (i.e.,
:literal:`INVENTORY_1`) would be applied globally. Inventories with
lower hierarchies would be ignored.

.. tip::

   Check the HEMCO log output for messages to make sure that none of
   your desired emissions have been skipped.

The solution is to make the boundaries of each defined mask region at least
a little bit smaller than the boundaries of the nested domain. This
involves inspecting the mask itself to make sure that no relevant
gridboxes will be excluded.

For example, assuming the simulation domain extends from 70E to 140E
in longitude, using this mask definition:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   1001 REGION_1_MASK ... 1 1 70/10/136/60

would prevent :literal:`INVENTORY_1` from being mistakely treated as a
global inventory. We hope to add improved error checking for this
condition into a future HEMCO version.

.. _hco-cfg-data-coll:

================
Data collections
================

The fields listed in :ref:`the HEMCO configuration file <hco-cfg>` data
collections. Collections can be enabled/disabled in section extension
switches. Only fields that are part of an enabled collection will be
used by HEMCO.

The beginning and end of a collection is indicated by an opening and
closing bracket, respectively: :literal:`(((CollectionName` and
:literal:`)))CollectionName`. These brackets must be on individual lines
immediately preceeding / following the first/last entry of a collection.
The same collection bracket can be used as many times as needed.

The collections are enabled/disabled in the Extension Switches section
(see :ref:`Extension Switches <hco-cfg-ext-switches>`). Each
collection name must be provided as an extension setting and can then
be readily enabled/disabled:

.. code-block:: kconfig

.. _hco-cfg-data-coll-ext-names:

Extension names
---------------

The collection brackets also work with :ref:`extension names
<hco-ext-list>`, e.g. data can be included/excluded based on
extensions. This is particularly useful to include an emission
inventory for standard emission calculation if (and only if) an
extension is not being used (see example below).

.. _hco-cfg-data-coll-undefined:

Undefined collections
---------------------

If, for a given collection, no corresponding entry is found in the
extensions section, it will be ignored. Collections are also ignored if
the collection is defined in an extension that is disabled. It is
recommended to list all collections under the base extension.

.. _hco-cfg-data-coll-exclude:

Exclude collections
-------------------

To use the opposite of a collection switch, .not. can be added in
front of an existing collection name. For instance, to read file
NOT_EMEP.nc only if EMEP is not being used:

.. code-block:: kconfig

   (((.not.EMEP
   0 NOT_EMEP_CO    $ROOT/NOT_EMEP.nc     CO 2000/1-12/1/0 C xy kg/m2/s CO 500/1001 1 2
   ))).not.EMEP

.. _hco-cfg-data-coll-combine:

Combine collections
-------------------

Multiple collections can be combined so that they are evaluated
together. This is achieved by linking collection names with .or..
For example, to use BOND biomass burning emissions only if both GFED and
FINN are not being used:
